# Linguaglow — Perfected Quest

Hi — I'm Mkhize975. This is my personal copy of the Lovable-generated Linguaglow project. I like things simple, practical, and focused on getting features running quickly. Below is how I work locally, edit on GitHub, and publish.

## Project info

Project URL: https://lovable.dev/projects/29968afa-679a-4dce-91de-876e7fafa2eb

## TL;DR — Get running locally

1. Clone the repo

```sh
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>
```

2. Use nvm to install and pick an LTS Node

```sh
nvm install --lts
nvm use --lts
npm install
```

3. Start the dev server

```sh
npm run dev
```

Open the address printed by the dev server (usually http://localhost:5173).

## How I edit this project

- Use Lovable: open the project link above and edit — changes sync back to this repo automatically.
- Edit locally with an IDE: clone, make changes, commit, and push. I keep commits frequent and messages concise.
- Quick fixes on GitHub: use the pencil icon in the file view.
- Codespaces: use a Codespace when I need a ready-made remote dev environment.

## Developer notes (my preferences)

- Node: stick to the latest LTS (Node 18+). Use nvm for consistency.
- Install: npm install
- Start (dev): npm run dev
- Build: npm run build
- Preview production build locally: npm run preview (if available)

If you add new dependencies, I run tests and a quick audit before merging.

## Tech stack

This project uses:

- Vite
- TypeScript
- React
- shadcn-ui
- Tailwind CSS

Language composition: mostly TypeScript.

## Deploying

I usually publish from Lovable: open the project and click Share → Publish. Alternatively, build with `npm run build` and deploy the `dist` folder to any static host that supports Vite builds.

## Custom domain

In Lovable: Project → Settings → Domains → Connect Domain. Docs: https://docs.lovable.dev/features/custom-domain#custom-domain

## Want to contribute or reach me?

Small, practical, and to the point — this README reflects how I like to work. If you want a different tone (more formal, more playful, or more technical), tell me which direction and I’ll update it again.
