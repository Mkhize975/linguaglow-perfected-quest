# Linguaglow — Perfected Quest

Linguaglow is a lightweight, privacy-first web app that helps users:
- Paraphrase text into clearer, more natural phrasing
- Generate working Excel formulas (IF, INDEX/MATCH, nested logic, dynamic arrays) from natural-language requests
- Proofread and translate paraphrases and formula instructions

Built by Mkhize975 for practical, client-first workflow: fast iterations, on-device inference where possible, and an emphasis on clear outputs that non-experts can use immediately.

### 🧪 How Judges Can Test the Application

To help the judges test LinguaGlow quickly:

#### 1️⃣ **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mkhize975/linguaglow-perfected-quest.git
cd linguaglow-perfected-quest
```

#### 2️⃣ **Install dependencies**

If using Node:

```bash
npm install
```

If using Python backend:

```bash
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
```

#### 3️⃣ **Run the app**

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open the URL shown in your terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

#### 4️⃣ **Test these examples**

* Paraphrasing:
  Input → “The meeting was postponed due to bad weather.”
  Output → “The meeting was delayed because of poor weather conditions.”

* Excel Formula Generation:
  Input → “Show me total sales where quantity > 50.”
  Output → `=SUMIF(B2:B100, ">50", C2:C100)`

* Proofreader Demo:
  Input → “He go to school every day.”
  Output → “He goes to school every day.”

#### 5️⃣ **Offline & Privacy Test**

* Try paraphrasing text while disconnected from the internet — LinguaGlow still works thanks to Chrome’s built-in on-device AI.
* Verify that no external API calls are made (privacy-first processing).

## ✅ 4. Add Repository Metadata (for hackathon judges)

In your GitHub repo, click **Settings → General → Description** and add:

```
LinguaGlow — AI-powered Chrome web app for paraphrasing, rewriting, and Excel formula generation using Chrome Built-in AI APIs (Gemini Nano).
```

Then add:

* ✅ Topics: `chrome-ai`, `gemini-nano`, `built-in-ai`, `paraphrasing`, `excel-formula-generator`, `ai-extension`, `hackathon2025`
* ✅ Public visibility
* ✅ Pin a demo screenshot (from `/demo/demo-video.mp4` or `demo/screenshot.png`)

---

## ✅ 5. Optional (but highly recommended)

### 🎥 Add a Demo Video

Record a short **2–3 minute demo video** showing:

* App launch
* Paraphrasing example
* Excel formula generation
* Quick voice tutor clip (if included)
  Upload it to `/demo/demo-video.mp4` or host it unlisted on YouTube and link it in the README.
