# Linguaglow ‚Äî Perfected Quest

Linguaglow is a lightweight, privacy-first web app that helps users:
- Paraphrase text into clearer, more natural phrasing
- Generate working Excel formulas (IF, INDEX/MATCH, nested logic, dynamic arrays) from natural-language requests
- Proofread and translate paraphrases and formula instructions

Built by Mkhize975 for practical, client-first workflow: fast iterations, on-device inference where possible, and an emphasis on clear outputs that non-experts can use immediately.

### üß™ How Judges Can Test the Application

To help the judges test LinguaGlow quickly:

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mkhize975/linguaglow-perfected-quest.git
cd linguaglow-perfected-quest
```

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Install dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

If using Python backend:

```bash
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
```

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Run the app**

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open the URL shown in your terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Test these examples**

* Paraphrasing:
  Input ‚Üí ‚ÄúThe meeting was postponed due to bad weather.‚Äù
  Output ‚Üí ‚ÄúThe meeting was delayed because of poor weather conditions.‚Äù

* Excel Formula Generation:
  Input ‚Üí ‚ÄúShow me total sales where quantity > 50.‚Äù
  Output ‚Üí `=SUMIF(B2:B100, ">50", C2:C100)`

* Proofreader Demo:
  Input ‚Üí ‚ÄúHe go to school every day.‚Äù
  Output ‚Üí ‚ÄúHe goes to school every day.‚Äù

#### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Offline & Privacy Test**

* Try paraphrasing text while disconnected from the internet ‚Äî LinguaGlow still works thanks to Chrome‚Äôs built-in on-device AI.
* Verify that no external API calls are made (privacy-first processing).

---

## ‚úÖ 5. Optional (but highly recommended)

### üé• Add a Demo Video

Record a short **2‚Äì3 minute demo video** showing:

* App launch
* Paraphrasing example
* Excel formula generation
* Quick voice tutor clip (if included)
  Upload it to `/demo/demo-video.mp4` or host it unlisted on YouTube and link it in the README.
